# Shared Agent Instructions

This folder contains common instructions and guidelines that apply to all agents working on the LLM Council project. Agents should reference these files to ensure consistency.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `code-standards.md` | Coding standards and style guide |
| `project-context.md` | Essential project knowledge |
| `safety-guidelines.md` | Security and safety protocols |

## How to Use

When creating or modifying agents, include relevant shared instructions by referencing them in the agent definition. This ensures consistent behavior across all specialized agents.

## Principles

1. **Consistency**: All agents follow the same base standards
2. **DRY**: Don't repeat common instructions in each agent
3. **Maintainability**: Update once, apply everywhere
4. **Clarity**: Keep shared instructions focused and clear
